use crate::predictions::prediction_types::PredictionType;

pub const PREFIX_INSTRUCTION: &str = r#"
- Perform technical analysis on price histories (1m, 5m, 1h, 4h, 1d) and order book volume:
  - Use 1m, 5m, and 1h equally for short-term signals (intraday focus). Prioritize 1m if rapid momentum shifts occur.
  - Use 4h and 1d to confirm broader trends or detect weekly patterns; weight 4h/1d higher only if volume exceeds 2x 10-period average and short-term signals (1m, 5m, 1h) do not strongly contradict.
- Detect momentum and reversals with key indicators:
  - Bullish: Stochastic RSI <20, price near lower Bollinger Band, rising bid volume, or EMA (9) crosses above EMA (21).
  - Bearish: Stochastic RSI >80, price near upper Bollinger Band, rising ask volume, or EMA (9) crosses below EMA (21).
- Use Fibonacci retracement/extension levels on 4h and 1d timeframes to identify key support/resistance zones:
  - Bullish: Target 61.8% or 100% extension above recent swing high if momentum confirms.
  - Bearish: Target 61.8% or 100% retracement below recent swing low if volume supports.
- Analyze bid/ask volume and price action across all timeframes:
  - Bullish signals: Bids outpace asks or price-volume divergence supports upside.
  - Bearish signals: Asks outpace bids or selling volume spikes at resistance.
- Account for weekly cycles and news events:
  - Increase confidence (+0.1) for bullish signals on historically strong days (e.g., Wednesday) or post-news spikes (e.g., 8:00 PM GMT+0).
  - Decrease confidence (-0.1) for trades against weekly slowdowns (e.g., Friday to Sunday) unless short-term volume contradicts.
  - If news context is unavailable, assume typical volatility spikes at 8:00 PM GMT+0 and adjust entry/target timing accordingly.
- Analyze historical volatility spikes (e.g., periods with >2x average ATR or volume) on 4h and 1d timeframes. Adjust entry and target timing to avoid whipsaws during spikes unless momentum aligns with the trade direction, in which case prioritize breakout entries.
- Confidence (0.0–1.0):
  - Base at 0.5, +0.1 per aligned indicator (e.g., RSI, volume, EMA, Fibonacci), -0.1 per conflict.
  - Include weekly cycle adjustments: +0.1 for bullish signals on strong days (e.g., Wednesday), -0.1 for trades during slowdowns (e.g., Friday-Sunday) unless short-term volume exceeds 1.5x average.
  - Suggest trades only if confidence ≥0.6; for 'Hold' on existing positions, require confidence ≥0.7; for 'No Action' if confidence <0.6 with no position.
  - Explicitly state confidence in the output JSON under a 'confidence' key.
- Focus on relative indicators (e.g., % changes, z-scores) over absolute levels to avoid overfitting.
- Ensure summary suggestion aligns with the existing position’s side (e.g., 'Hold long position' for longs, 'Hold short position' for shorts) unless suggesting 'Close' or 'Reverse'.
"#;

pub const INPUT_INSTRUCTION: &str = r#"
- Kline data is provided as a CSV format.
- Timestamps are in milliseconds (e.g., 1741870260000); prices and volume are floats (e.g., 123.45, 1000.5).
- Assume data is sorted by open_time ascending and matches the requested timeframe (e.g., 1m, 5m, 1h).
"#;

pub const MAIN_TRADE_INSTRUCTION: &str = r#"
- Predict the next price top or bottom using:
  - Bollinger Bands for overbought/oversold levels.
  - EMA crossovers (e.g., 9-period EMA vs. 21-period EMA) across all timeframes.
  - Fibonacci levels (e.g., 61.8% retracement for shorts, 100% extension for longs) aligned with recent swing highs/lows.
  - Recent price action and volume trends from order book.
- Suggest entry timing based on short-term signals (1m, 5m, 1h) aligning with predicted tops/bottoms.
- Provide target_price with ≥2.5% profit potential, calculated independently of any existing position’s target:
  - Longs: Above upper Bollinger Band, recent high, or Fibonacci 61.8%/100% extension, based on current market data.
  - Shorts: Below lower Bollinger Band, recent low, or Fibonacci 61.8%/100% retracement, based on current market data.
- Include stop_loss to limit risk below profit potential, derived from volatility, support/resistance, or recent price action, independent of existing position parameters.
"#;

pub const SUB_PERPS_INSTRUCTION: &str = r#"
- Ensure the open position side is identified as "long" or "short" before making a suggestion.
- If no position exists (positions is null):
    - Suggest 'Buy' or 'Sell' if confidence ≥0.6 with at least two confirming indicators (e.g., Stochastic RSI, volume trends, EMA crossovers, Fibonacci levels) and provide entry_price, target_price, and stop_loss.
    - Suggest 'No Action' if confidence <0.6 or signals are mixed/insufficient.
- For existing positions, suggest one of the following actions based on current momentum, price action, and volume, with logical risk management:
    - 'Hold': If short-term momentum clearly aligns with the position’s side (e.g., bullish for longs, bearish for shorts) with confidence ≥0.7 and at least two confirming indicators (e.g., Stochastic RSI, volume trends, EMA crossovers). Avoid 'Hold' if momentum is mixed or opposes the position.
    - 'Increase': If at least two short-term indicators strongly confirm the position’s direction (e.g., rising momentum, favorable volume, price action) with confidence >0.7.
    - 'Close': If short-term signals oppose the position’s side (e.g., bearish signals for longs, bullish for shorts), or the position nears its target, stop-loss, or liquidation risk.
    - 'Reverse': If short-term signals strongly oppose the position’s side with confidence ≥0.7, suggest closing the current position and opening an opposite one with a new entry_price, target_price, and stop_loss based on current market conditions.
- Set stop_loss values to manage risk effectively:
    - Base stop_loss on volatility, support/resistance levels, or recent price action (e.g., below key support for longs, above resistance for shorts).
    - Position stop_loss between the entry_price and liquidation_price, ensuring a buffer to exit before liquidation (e.g., 25-50% of the distance to liquidation, adjusted for volatility).
    - For shorts, set stop_loss above entry_price but well below liquidation_price; for longs, below entry_price but above liquidation_price.
    - For reversals, use a tighter stop_loss to protect against whipsaws, closer to entry than initial positions.
    - Align stop_loss with market context and position direction, avoiding arbitrary values unless risk tolerance justifies them.

pub const SUB_GRAPH_INSTRUCTION: &str = r#"
- Predict 24 klines value for 1h timeframe based on technical analysis and vibe.
- Ensure that suggested long/short signals match predicted klines time and value.
"#;

pub const SUB_CONSOLIDATE_INSTRUCTION: &str = r#"
- Focus on key indicators like price action, moving averages, Bollinger Bands, MACD, Stochastic RSI, and volume.
- Consider the confidence level (0.65) and rationale provided in the signals.
- If the charts align with the bearish bias and the suggested entry price (130.55) is reasonable given current price (130.39), confirm the trade.
- If there are discrepancies (e.g., conflicting signals in the charts, low confidence, or unfavorable risk-reward ratio), reject the trade.
- Return your decision using the `execute_trade_decision` function with the following parameters:
  - `pair_symbol`: "SOL_USDT"
  - `should_trade`: true or false (whether to execute the trade)
  - `rationale`: A brief explanation of your decision

### Tasks
1. Analyze the 15m, 1h, 4h, and 1d charts to confirm the trends, resistance/support levels, and indicator signals (e.g., MACD, Stochastic RSI, Bollinger Bands, volume).
2. Cross-reference the chart analysis with the provided summary and signals.
3. Decide whether to execute the suggested trade (short SOL_USDT at X with a target of Y and stop-loss at Z).
4. Use the provided function `execute_trade_decision` to return your decision."#;
